Many angles are explored. Why was Elvis unhappy? How is habitual Schadenfreude and automatic bile ensmallening our culture? Can we ever be—let alone feel—truly secure?

Why and how do we get so hung up and frustrated about getting good at what we do? Why's it so hard to take an abstract idea for making something great, then end up feeling pathologically stymied when we struggle to actually make it? The boys return to the classic topic of expertise, especially the frustrating ironies that separate the pro from the amateur from the, as they say, \"failure.\" Also under consideration is Roger Von Oech's fascinating modal, character-based approach to making stuff—acknowledging the very different work of the Explorer, Artist, Judge, and Warrior. But, critically, also striving to keep those characters in the right order and on the right parts of the right task at the right time. Then, knowing when to change things up. Finally, there's a bit of discussion on Merlin's squirrely obsession with focal length—to not only choose the right mode at the right time, but to stay open to the idea of alternately zooming way out and way in at each step of the process. Accepting the benefits and trade-offs of switching between your macro and fish-eye lenses. It's a really good episode—at least way better than it sounds. And, the hosts agree that, until you find a better model for understanding How to Make Stuff, you could do a lot worse than giving this admittedly Byzantine method a spin for yourself.",

Even before we find our forks in the road, how can we know a big decision might or should be coming our way? And, how do we stay current on that never-ending need to accept and plan for the changes we never could have anticipated? It's tough at 23, it's super-hard at 30, and, brother, is it ever murder at 50. Sure, it's a little fruity, but, yeah: you need to write the story you really want to live.

When does self-improvement silently shade into navel-gazing, and how do we realize that it's happening? Some fixes mean applying a fast change that produces outsized results (a true \"life hack\"). But, most of our more circuitous excursions into the world of ““productivity”” lead straight into a recursive black hole of lost time, sheer frustration, and soul-sucking existential onanism (let's call that one a \"life whack\"). Learn how to live with your dirty debit card, just satisfice with your dish-washing skills, and quit trying to solve non-problems with non-solutions. Yes, learn the key commands, but, don't feel like you need to learn all the key commands. Iterate with mindful sanity. And, like it says on the tin: always focus on how you'll get back to work.",

The answer is simple, but it&#8217;s not so easy. You need a trusted system in which to collect, process, review, and—yes—do all the things that matter. Getting Things Done is inarguably one of the best and most influential self-help books of all time for a good reason: it&#8217;s a candid, realistic, and painfully honest way to get out of your hole, and then stay out. This week, we start with the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of GTD, as well as the myriad and thorny problems it can help you address. So, pick up your own copy of GTD, read it through, then join us for a detailed tour of the system that changed Merlin&#8217;s game and helped jumpstart his online career. ©DavidCo, 2001. &#160;&#8617;",

    "summary": "TOPIC: Sleep and How to Get It This week, Dan and Merlin talk about sleep—why we need it, why most of us don't get enough of it, and why we all strain to find a million excuses for perpetually walking around like a sad zombie. Chock-a-block with painful personal anecdotes, horrible cautionary tales, and scary hand-waving about Recent Medical Science, your hosts make their best case for taking your own sleep more seriously. Now. Also, loaded with tips on how to sleep better, with a heavy emphasis on a wonderful iOS app called, \"Sleep Cycle.\" Pretty good for our last episode. (Guys, we were kidding! KIDDING!)",

Why'd Merlin give up on learning \"Little Brown Jug\" on the trombone, then double-down on nailing \"Pinball Wizard\" on guitar? How come Dan got so good at programming, but can't kick a damned football to save his life? Is there a framework for understanding why we remember hit points, don't travel, can't draw, and forget why every good boy deserves fudge? Along the way, Merlin accidentally—grudgingly—reveals that he actually knows things about sportsball, Dan breaks down the exhilarating rewards of immediate feedback, and both hosts wonder how Mariano Rivera can keep his cool after giving up a two-run homer. Also, there's a pseudo-interesting rathole on why Merlin may or may not start spending more time with App.net.",

The upshot? Try not to get too obsessed with someone else's ether in the convertible or, for that matter, the cake in your own conference room.
